                        <p><strong>Socotra Archipelago</strong>, in the northwest Indian Ocean near the Gulf of Aden, is 250 km long and comprises four islands and two rocky islets which appear as a prolongation of the <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Horn_of_Africa" target="_blank">Horn of Africa</a>. The site is of universal importance because of its biodiversity with rich and distinct flora and fauna: 37% of Socotra’s 825 plant species, 90% of its reptile species and 95% of its land snail species <em>do not occur anywhere else in the world</em>.</p>
                        <p>The site also supports globally significant populations of land and sea birds (192 bird species, 44 of which breed on the islands while 85 are regular migrants), including a number of threatened species. The marine life of <strong>Socotra</strong> is also very diverse, with 253 species of reef-building corals, 730 species of coastal fish and 300 species of crab, lobster and shrimp.</p>

                        <p><strong>Socotra</strong> is rich in terms of biodiversity, comparing favorably with such island groups as Galapagos, Mauritius, and the <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Canary_Islands" target="_blank">Canary Islands</a>. It has been referred to as the <em>"jewel"</em> of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea.</p>
                        <p>The long geological isolation of the <strong>Socotra archipelago</strong> and its fierce heat and drought have combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora. Surveys have revealed that of a total of nearly 900 species, a 37 percent are endemic; ranking it in the top five islands in terms of endemic flora. <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Botany" target="_blank">Botanists </a> rank the Socotra flora among <em>the ten most endangered island flora in the world</em>, vulnerable to introduced species such as goats, climate change, and modernization. The archipelago is a site of global importance for biodiversity conservation and a possible center for ecotourism.</p>
                        <p>One of the most striking of <strong>Socotra's</strong> plants is the dragon's blood tree <em>"Dracaena cinnabari"</em>, which is an unusual looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Lore has it that its red sap was the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a medicine and a dye. Another unusual plant is Dorstenia gigas, a succulent that can grow to eight feet tall and have a trunk of up to two feet or more in diameter.</p>

                        <p>In 1996 Yemen ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), an international treaty that was adopted in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 and entered into force on December 29, 1993. Also in 1996, Yemen declared the Socotra Archipelago a special, natural area in urgent need of protection. The CBD covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources and links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it <em>'Parties'</em> are obliged to implement its provisions. This is seen as a means of a possible boost to Socotra's economy as well as a way to provide protection to the natural environment.</p>
                        <p>The island was recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a natural World Heritage Site in July 2008. The European Union has supported such a move, calling on both UNESCO and the International Organization of Protecting Environment to classify the island archipelago among the environmental heritages, for more info please click <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Socotra" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
